Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.

Move that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).

Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

Viewing your project on the web
If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above), doing this is incredibly simple.

GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name.

A GitHub paid account is required to publish a private repository.
There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

Make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
Go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the Settings button as shown in the screenshot below.Screenshot pointing to the Settings located in an example repository
Click on Pages on the left side bar.
Change the Branch from none to main branch and click Save.
It may take a few minutes (The GitHub website says up to 10, but we’ve seen it take up to an hour. Do not add a “theme” to your project, or you may have git conflicts, instead, be patient.) but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).

If your project does not publish after 1 hour, ensure that you have a file called index.html in the root of your repository and all the settings have been set correctly. Go to your repo on GitHub and click on Actions, if there are no entries, then go back to the settings, change the Branch from main branch to none and click Save, then change the Branch from none to main branch and click Save.
